Lack of Input Validation: The code assumes that the input parameters are always
valid and of the expected type. It doesn't include any input validation or
error handling for scenarios where invalid or unexpected input is provided.
Adding appropriate input validation and error handling can make the code more
robust and prevent potential issues.

Inconsistent Error Handling: The code raises `KeyError` exceptions in some cases
(e.g., when a character set or font set is not found), but it doesn't handle
these exceptions consistently across all methods. It's important to have a
consistent error handling strategy and provide meaningful error messages to the
users of the code.

Limited Documentation: While there are some docstrings provided for the classes,
the documentation is limited and doesn't provide a clear explanation of the
purpose and usage of each class and method. Comprehensive and up-to-date
documentation is crucial for understanding and maintaining the codebase
effectively.

Lack of Unit Tests: The code doesn't include any unit tests to verify the
correctness of the implemented functionality. Writing unit tests helps catch
bugs, ensures the code behaves as expected, and provides a safety net for
future modifications.

These are some of the main issues and concerns that I can identify based on the
provided code. Addressing these issues would involve refactoring the code to
improve its structure, consistency, encapsulation, error handling, and
documentation, as well as adding appropriate unit tests to ensure its
correctness and maintainability.
