## Main
- Font sets, such as fonts with similar attribute inside the current folder or just
  arbitrary number of fonts that are added to the object.
- Make groups compatible inside a fontset and also change the kerning for the new groups
- Sort fonts based on os2/weight class or shared glyph widths or shared glyph bounds

## Subset
- Subsetting classes can cause the statement `sub @init_src by @init_des;` to drop. This
  could be because the subsetter doesn't subset the classes by making sure the matching
  items between src and des inside these type of clasess also gets subset.
- If these objects are not referenced, they should be removed:
    Classes, LanguageSystemStatement, FeatureReferenceStatement
- If a class doesn't exist it shouldn't be referenced inside another class
    definition.

## Kerning
- merge (add kerning from another font without overriding the current)
- copy/override (add kerning from another font by overriding the current)
- Copy kerning from another font per glyph basis, and same for groups
- copyKerning method on the glyph obj

## Groups
- merge (add kerning from another font without overriding the current)
